const HELP: &str = "\
termctrl controls and captures terminal applications for agents and tests. Start a named live
application, read its visible screen with `show`, or retain selected artifacts with `save`.";

const ROOT_EXAMPLES: &str = "\
Examples:
  termctrl show -- my-terminal-app
  termctrl save --format png --out captures/app.png -- my-terminal-app
  termctrl start demo --host opentui -- opencode
  termctrl run editor -- nvim
  termctrl wait demo '/connect' && termctrl send demo text:/connect enter
  termctrl show demo
  termctrl show demo --format semantic
  termctrl save demo --format png --out captures/provider.png
  termctrl logs demo
  termctrl restart demo
  termctrl stop demo";

const SHOW_HELP: &str = "\
Show prints a settled visible terminal screen to standard output, as text by default.

Sources:
  termctrl show NAME                    Read a named live session.
  termctrl show -- COMMAND...           Run a disposable command in a PTY.
  termctrl show --pipe -- COMMAND...    Read piped stdout/stderr.
  termctrl show --input FILE            Read ANSI/VT bytes from FILE, or use - for stdin.
  termctrl show --recording FILE        Replay the final screen of a .termctrl recording.

Use --format json, --format ansi, or --format svg for another terminal representation. Use
`--format semantic` with a named target for optional application-provided UI semantics.
Use `--at-marker NAME` or `--at-ms MS` with --recording to inspect an exact moment. Use `save`
to write files.";

const SAVE_HELP: &str = "\
Save freezes a visible terminal screen and writes exactly the requested artifact formats.

Examples:
  termctrl save demo --format png --out captures/current.png
  termctrl save demo --format png --format txt --out captures/current
  termctrl save --input debug.ansi --format png --out captures/replay.png
  termctrl save --recording captures/demo.termctrl --at-marker done --format png --out captures/done.png
  termctrl save --format png --out captures/startup.png -- my-terminal-app";

const START_HELP: &str = "\
Start creates one background PTY session and returns once its local control socket is available.
The application stays alive until `termctrl stop NAME`, so later commands interact with the
same screen and application state. Persistent sessions currently require macOS or Linux. Session
sockets are local control endpoints protected for the current user; recordings contain terminal
output plus client and automatic host input, so treat them as sensitive artifacts.

Example:
  termctrl start demo --host opentui --cols 112 --rows 34 -- opencode
  termctrl status demo
  termctrl wait demo '/connect'
  termctrl send demo text:/connect enter
  termctrl resize demo --cols 132 --rows 38
  termctrl show demo
  termctrl save demo --format png --out captures/provider.png
  termctrl stop demo";

const RUN_HELP: &str = "\
Run starts a PTY session in the foreground and mirrors it through the current terminal. Omit NAME
to use the executable basename as the session name. Inferred names must be valid session names and
must not collide with an existing session.
The application remains directly visible and interactive in this terminal pane while agents use
the same named-session commands to inspect its screen, send input, and resize it. The application
exits with this foreground command; no terminal multiplexer or terminal-specific API is required.

Examples:
  termctrl run editor --cwd ~/src/project -- nvim
  termctrl run -- /usr/bin/nvim";

const SEND_HELP: &str = "\
Send ordered input to a live session. Text uses `text:<value>`; named keys include `enter`,
`escape`, arrows, `tab`, `shift-tab`, `backspace`, `delete`, `home`, `end`, `page-up`, and
`page-down`. Use `ctrl-a` through `ctrl-z` for control input such as `ctrl-c` cancellation.
Add `--pace-ms 35` when producing a human-readable recording so typed text appears character by
character in the terminal instead of as one immediate paste. Use `--stdin` to send exact bytes
from standard input as one burst.

Examples:
  termctrl send demo ctrl-p text:model enter
  termctrl send demo ctrl-c
  printf '%s' 'a multiline prompt' | termctrl send demo --stdin
  termctrl send demo --pace-ms 35 'text:Write a terminal haiku.' enter";

const VIDEO_HELP: &str = "\
Replay a recording produced by `termctrl start --record` into a video artifact. Without `--edit`,
the video preserves observed timing. For a concise annotated demo, add named moments while recording
with `termctrl mark`, then pass an edit-plan JSON file with `--edit`. Each clip selects a marker range
and may set `speed`, optional visible `caption`, or optional `hold_ms`. Omit `hold_ms` for no artificial
pause between clips. Use `--tail-ms 0` if the final frame should not be held after the last clip.

`--fps` controls the maximum sampled frame rate; identical rendered screens are rasterized once and
reused. Pass `--include-startup` to retain blank startup or capability negotiation frames. The source
`.termctrl` file always retains the original timing, terminal bytes, client input, automatic host
input, and markers until the session is closed. Video export requires `ffmpeg` to be installed.
Pass `--footer` to add a bottom row with the clip caption, elapsed timecode, and TERMINAL CONTROL
branding; without it, edit-plan captions render as inline annotation rows.

Pass `--pointer-overlay` to visualize typed `termctrl mouse` input with an animated arrow.
Pointer exports default to 60 fps (otherwise 20); `--fps` overrides either. Travel arrives at the
input instant, presses compress subtly, and idle pointers fade. `--pointer-reduced-motion` keeps
fades without travel or scaling. No animation changes real input timing. Raw bytes and forwarded
human input are not inferred as mouse events. `--hide-cursor` hides only the text cursor.

Example:
  termctrl start demo --record captures/demo.termctrl -- opencode
  termctrl mark demo before-connect
  termctrl send demo text:/connect enter
  termctrl mark demo after-connect
  termctrl stop demo
  termctrl markers captures/demo.termctrl
  termctrl video captures/demo.termctrl --edit captures/demo.json --tail-ms 0 --out captures/demo.mp4";

const MARK_HELP: &str = "\
Add a named marker to the active `.termctrl` recording at the current session time. Markers do not
change the raw recording; they give later `show --recording --at-marker` and `video --edit` commands
stable names for important moments.

Example:
  termctrl start demo --record captures/demo.termctrl -- opencode
  termctrl wait demo \"Ask anything\"
  termctrl mark demo ready
  termctrl send demo text:/connect enter
  termctrl mark demo after-connect";

const MARKERS_HELP: &str = "\
List named markers from a .termctrl recording. Use the timestamps to audit an edit plan, or inspect
screens with `termctrl show --recording FILE --at-marker NAME` before exporting a demo video.";

const DRIVER_HELP: &str = "\
Driver mode serves isolated embedded sessions as newline-delimited JSON over standard input and
standard output. It is used by the `@kitlangton/terminal-control` package; standard output
contains protocol messages only. Driver sessions support isolated child environments, stable
captures, SVG evidence, recordings, resizing, and explicit exit waiting.

Example:
